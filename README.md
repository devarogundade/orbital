# ORBITAL

Orbital is a cutting-edge cross-chain lending platform that leverages wormhole technology and Supra Oracles to revolutionize decentralized finance (DeFi). By enabling seamless and secure lending and borrowing across multiple blockchain networks like SUI, and Avalanche, Orbital maximizes liquidity and capital efficiency. The integration of Supra Oracles ensures accurate, real-time data for price feeds and interest rates.

We designed our cross-chain lending app to feel like a DEX that many blockchain users are accustomed to, rather than splitting the supply and borrow functions. This approach simplifies the user experience, making it one-click to borrow. The app features a unified interface where users can manage all transactions from a single dashboard, mimicking the layout and ease of use found in popular DEX platforms.
